# GPUPathTracer

A Wavefront path tracer written in C++/CUDA. Currently just a basic reference path tracer with lambertian materials only.

Features to add:
 - Camera movement
 - Specular/Refractive/Frensel materials
 - Next Event Estimation
 - Cosine weighted importance sampling
 - Russian Roulette termination
 - BVH Acceleration structue/.obj loading
 - Texturing
 - Probs extra stuff that I haven't though of yet
 
 Bugs (to remind myself what I need to fix)
 - Different window sizes act strange
